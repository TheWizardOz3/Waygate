# Plan Feature

Plan the **[FEATURE NAME]** feature:

1. Read `docs/project_status.md` and `docs/product_spec.md` and `docs/architecture.md` and any relevant feature docs
2. Break into atomic implementation tasks (~30-60 min each). Don't include unit and integration tests in this list, those should be a sparate test plan which is handled as a final action outside of the task list. Feel free to include a test plan in the feature doc though.
3. Create a feature doc in `docs/Features/[feature-name].md` outlining the feature and the implementation tasks.
4. Update `docs/project_status.md` to mark this feature as in-progress (keep this update context-light). Do not update any other files.

Start with step 1.
