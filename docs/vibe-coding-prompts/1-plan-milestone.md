# Plan Milestone

Review the **[MILESTONE NAME]** milestone:

1. Read `docs/project_status.md` and `docs/product_spec.md` and `docs/architecture.md`
2. Plan the milestone out and list all features in priority/dependency order
3. Identify sequencing constraints (what must be built first)
4. Create a recommended build order
5. Update the `docs/project_status.md`doc with the build order sequencing details

Start with step 1.
