# Plan Milestone

Review the **[MILESTONE NAME]** milestone:

1. Read `docs/project_status.md` and `docs/product_spec.md` and `docs/architecture.md`
2. Review any relevant feature docs and plan the milestone out and list all features in priority/dependency order based on any sequencing constraints around what must be built first (don't over-engineer this, don't break it into phases or anything just list the ordering of the features to build because there will be standalone planning processes for each individual feature. The goal right now is just to identify work order.)
3. Create a recommended build order
4. Update the `docs/project_status.md`doc with the build order sequencing details (again, keep this update lightweight and keep it context-light as each feature will be planned, built, and handled individually). Do not update any other files.

Start with step 1.
